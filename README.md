# codecademy

This is my 401 prework for my codecademy assignments, 3-7. I have copied my final code from each CC chapter and created a .py file for each. I originally had them git a git repo named codecademy, working in master. I then re-read the directions and remnamed my git repo and then created a branch. I pushed all my existing files up into the proper branch and will then create a PR but NOT merge, as instructed.
